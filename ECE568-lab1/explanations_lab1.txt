## Sploit 1 

There is a vulnterability in the target1 program within the foo() function where
it preforms a strcpy of args[1] into a 96 byte buffer. We infiltrate the target 
program through the args[1] variable which holds our attack_buffer. By extending 
the length of our attack_buffer with NOPs enough such that it overwrites the return address 
with the encapsualted exploit string, the sploit gains shell control of the target 
machine. 

rip - &buf = 120 bytes = length of our attack buffer
last 4 bytes are the address of the start of the attac buffer:
	-> where our shell code is
		-> gives control

TODO: Finish Explanation

There is a vulnerability in the target program within the foo() function where 
it calls bar() to copy up to 88 bytes from arg into buf when buf is limited at 
the size of 64 bytes.
